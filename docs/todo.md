### Bugs
localTime for scores on the first block is simTime with decimal when it should be unix non decimal


### Improvements

timestamps
  - Pools update hashers every few minutes
    -> need to model how timestamps differ from receive time

Hashrate oscillation modeling

Variable .env parameters over simulation runs 


### Research / Usage

Partition healing under various models 

Network fracturing tolerances under varying latency tunables
